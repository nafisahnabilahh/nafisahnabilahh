A passionate Software Engineering graduate with a love for precision and excellence in software testing and quality assurance. 
Currently, I am on an exciting journey of self-discovery and skill enhancement as I immerse myself 
in various online courses, experimenting with web applications for learning purposes.

Education:
Bachelor of Computer Science in Software Engineering, (UTHM, 2024)

While my coding skills were robust, I recognized that success in the tech industry requires more than just talent. 
It demands passionâ€”the secret sauce that propels one towards excellence. Despite my coding prowess, 
I took a leap of faith and redirected my focus towards quality assurance. 
It's a risk I'm eager to embrace because I firmly believe that combining talent with passion is 
the key to thriving in this ever-evolving landscape.

I am on a mission to apply the knowledge I've acquired to real-world scenarios, testing operational products and gaining hands-on experience. This aligns seamlessly with my current career goalâ€”becoming a mid-level software tester in the next two years. I am confident that this journey will not only shape my career but also contribute to the ever-growing field of software testing.
